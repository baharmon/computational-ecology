# Computational Ecology

<p align="center"><img src="images/yosemite/yosemite_sq.png" height="500"></p>

In this studio you will learn computational methods for ecological modeling
and use them to plan for the future of Yosemite national park.
This studio will introduce advanced topics
in landscape ecology and biodiversity conservation
such as shifting ecological baselines, process-form interaction,
systematic conservation planning, and climate change adaptation.
You will learn how to model ecological patterns
and simulate ecological processes
using Geographic Information Systems (GIS).
You will learn visual programming, geospatial programming in Python,
digital fabrication methods, and advanced 3D rendering.
You will apply these methods to develop a long-term landscape plan
for the national park.
Each week you will spend
a day in a seminar discussing ecological theory and its applications,
a day in a workshop learning new computational methods,
and a day developing your projects.
There will be an optional fieldtrip to Yosemite National Park
the week before the semester starts.
