# Projects

In this studio you will apply emerging ecological theory and modeling
to plan habitat corridors for the
[Yellowstone to Yukon](https://y2y.net/) conservation initiative -
a grand vision to connect large patches of wilderness
to conserve biodiversity in increasingly fragmented landscapes.
After mapping and analyzing the ecosystems
you will develop a planning methodology
and then use it to design a habitat corridor.

Upload digital copies of your work to the class network drive
at `\\desn-knox.lsu.edu\Landscape-Classes` on Windows
or `smb://desn-knox.lsu.edu/Landscape-Classes` on Mac.

## Mapping and analysis
Map 

Topics include
topography, hydrology, urbanization, transportation networks,
ecoregions, fragmentation, ecological metrics,
species ranges, biodiversity, patterns of development,
historic fires, and climate change.

---

## Planning methodology
Develop a GIS-based planning methodology
for identifying the best routes for habitat corridors.
Account for issues such as
fragmentation, fire risk, urbanization, migration, and climate change.
